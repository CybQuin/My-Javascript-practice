            Javascript Let

        </h2>
        <p>Redeclaring a Javascript variable with <b> var </b> is allowed anywhere in a program:
        Redeclaring a variable with <b> let </b> in another scope, or in another  block, is allowed.
    With var you cab use a variable before it is declared:</p>
        
        <p id="demo"> </p>   
    
    </body>
    <script>
        //carName = "Volvo";
        //document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
        //var carName;
       // var x=12;
        //var x=3;
        //let x = 10;
     /*   With let, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.
        {
            let x = 2;
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
        }
        //Here x is 10. */
       // document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

       /*let x = 2;
       {
        let x = 3;
       }
       {
        let x = 4;
       }
       document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
       It keeps a value constant for a period of time.
       Always use the const when you know a value cannot be changed.
       It can be use to declare a new array, a new object, a new function, a new regexp.
       IN A CONSTANT, YOU CAN'T REASSIGN A CONSTANT VALUE.
       REASSIGN A CONSTANT ARRAY
       REASSIGN A CONSTANT OBJECT.
       
       BUT YOU CAN;
       Change the elements of the constant array;
       change the properties of constant object
       
       Types of Javascript Operators.
       There are different types of Javascript Operators.
       Assignment Operators, Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators,
       String Operators, Logical Operators,  Bitwise Operators, Ternary Operators,
       Type Operators.
       x += 5 adds x to 5.
       === means equal value and equal type.

     <p> Declaring a constant does not make its elements unchangeable. </p>
<p> You can change the properties of a constant object
    Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed.
    Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
    This means you can use a var before it is declared.
    A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or expressions) and
    produces a new one.
